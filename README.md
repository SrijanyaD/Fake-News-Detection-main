# Fake-News-Detection-main

AI fake news detector helps detect fake news through binary classification techniques and helps build better experiences by controlling the flow of disinformation in politics, businesses, climate change, and more. The tool works by training a neural network to spot fake articles based on their text content. When you run your own data through the tool, it gives you back a list of articles that it thinks are likely to be fake. You can then train the model further or decide if those results are acceptable or not. In addition to identifying fake news, this model can also be trained to identify real news. This allows you to compare the model's performance across different domains 

Pre-requisite

The app requires python3 to be installed in the machine as the programming language used is Python
